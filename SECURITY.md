# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
The EasyPGP project is an open-source project that aims to provide a convenient way to generate PGP key pairs, encrypt messages, and decrypt messages. As an open-source project, the support and maintenance of the project are driven by the community. Therefore, only the latest version of the project will receive regular updates and security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover any security vulnerabilities or issues within the EasyPGP project, please report them to our security team by emailing carlos.henrique.de.paula.oliveira@hotmail.com.

## Scope
The security policy applies specifically to the EasyPGP project and its associated code repositories. Issues discovered in any third-party dependencies should be reported directly to the respective maintainers of those projects.
